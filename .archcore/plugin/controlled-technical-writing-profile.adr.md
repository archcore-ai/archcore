## Context

Before `@AGENTS.md` existed, the repository's only writing constraints were plugin runtime assets: `@plugin/plugins/archcore/skills/_shared/precision-rules.md` (forbidden lexicon, imperative modals, `[assumption]` marking, no cross-document body sections, architect voice) and the per-type contracts beside it. Those assets bind an agent composing a `.archcore/` document, and `@plugins/archcore/bin/check-precision` applies its strict-EARS checks — one modal per numbered line (7b) and an active-voice obligated subject (7c) — to `spec` bodies only. Nothing constrained `README.md`, `docs/**`, the skill and agent instruction files under `plugins/archcore/`, or the sentence-level structure of `rule`, `guide`, and decision documents. The result was a corpus of 81 `.archcore/` documents (9258 lines) in which requirement phrasing, actor visibility, and step granularity varied by author and by session.

## Decision

Adopted the internal controlled technical writing profile defined in `@AGENTS.md` — ASD-STE100-inspired for procedures, requirements, rules, specifications, and agent instructions; ISO 24495-1-inspired for document organization and explanatory content — binding on `.archcore/**`, `plugins/archcore/skills/**`, `plugins/archcore/agents/**`, `plugins/archcore/copilot-agents/**`, `plugins/archcore/rules/**`, `docs/**`, and `README.md`, with the five-level precedence order stated in `@AGENTS.md` and a one-time normalization pass over all 81 existing `.archcore/` documents.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Extend `@plugin/plugins/archcore/skills/_shared/precision-rules.md` instead of adding a repository-level policy** — rejected because that file is a plugin runtime asset shipped to consumer projects; repository-specific obligations covering `README.md` and `docs/**` would then bind every downstream plugin user, which `precision-over-coverage.adr.md` already ruled out for project-local content.
2. **Declare ASD-STE100 and ISO 24495-1 compliance** — ruled out because neither standard was applied through its certification process; `@AGENTS.md` states explicitly that the profile is an internal writing profile and not a claim of compliance, certification, or approval.
3. **Generalize the `check-precision` strict-EARS checks (7b, 7c) from `spec` to every normative type and write no policy** — deferred because those checks operate on numbered lines only; they cannot evaluate section ordering, actor visibility in prose, or the placement of a warning before the action it guards.
4. **Leave the existing corpus untouched and apply the profile only to new documents** — rejected by the user on 2026-08-03 in favor of normalizing the whole corpus in one pass, accepting the diff cost recorded below.

## Consequences

- The precedence order gives an agent a single deterministic resolution path when `@AGENTS.md` and a type contract disagree: the type contract wins, so `@plugin/plugins/archcore/skills/_shared/spec-contract.md` mandatory sections are not displaced by the general policy.
- [expected] Requirement lines across `rule` and `spec` documents become uniformly checkable by review — one obligation, one modal, one named actor — matching the contract that `check-precision` already enforces for `spec` bodies.
- Tradeoff: all 81 documents are rewritten in one commit, so `git log -p .archcore/plugin/` per-document archaeology crosses a single large diff at that commit.
- Tradeoff: `precision-over-coverage.adr.md` records that existing documents are not retroactively flagged as invalid. That stance is narrowed, not reversed — no validation gate rejects a pre-existing document; the corpus is normalized once by an explicit authoring pass.
- Items beyond the forbidden lexicon and the `spec`-only EARS checks had no automated verifier when this was decided; they rested on the review checklist in `@AGENTS.md`, applied by the authoring agent.
- Two of the supersession triggers below have since fired, and neither reversed this decision. The profile obligations moved to the `archcore` global source, and the set the engine checks grew past three obligations — sections for every type, the line form each type takes, the word metrics, and the trigger order. Both were serviced by reshaping the local rule to scope, precedence resolution, and enforcement, and by rewriting its Enforcement section to name the current verifier. The spent triggers are removed below.

## Superseded when

- The repository publishes documentation in a second natural language, which requires the Russian-language clauses of `@AGENTS.md` to become a separate contract rather than a subsection.
- A consumer project reports that documents authored under the plugin's shipped contracts diverge structurally from documents authored in this repository, indicating the repository policy leaked into the shipped runtime assets.
- The engine's checks begin to block a write instead of reporting it, which turns an advisory profile into a validation gate and reopens the retroactive-invalidation question `precision-over-coverage.adr` settled.
- A second runtime composes documents over the same engine, which makes the shipped contracts one composition path among several rather than the only one.
