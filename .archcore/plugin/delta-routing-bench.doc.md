## Overview

Reference corpus for the delta-routing model: 40 real tasks — 14 from archcore-ai/plugin issues and commit history, 26 from other stacks and domains — each traced to the route the model computes. Source material for the behavioral routing tests that accompany each rollout phase. Traces recorded 2026-08-15 from the design session that produced the model; each route is the model's predicted output, not an executed run [assumption]. Verified 2026-08-15 against the implemented conductor contract by a 12-trace dry-run; the divergences it surfaced were resolved by rule amendments in the contract — a standalone `plan` contribution for `decision` and `amendment` routes with multi-task implementation, intent-gap scaling (a gap that fits one capability's purpose records in that capability's `spec`, no `prd`), and one additional size-label step when iso links engage.

First harness run 2026-08-15, four parallel conductor sessions over the 42 fixtures in @plugin/test/behavioral/fixtures/routing-bench.tsv (runner: @plugin/test/behavioral/route-bench.sh, `make test-routing-bench`): 42 of 42 route names match the fixtures. Three announcements carried internal inconsistencies at the field level — a `null` route declaring `intent_gap: yes` with a contract instrument (N+1 trace), and two settled decisions profiled as `user`-source Π — so announcement-field consistency is the runner's next scoring dimension beyond the route name.

Legend: Δ — canon delta (`∅` none, `mod` modifies accepted spec, `new×N` creates N capabilities, `dec` decision delta, `+int` intent gap). Π — dominant information source (`machine`, `user`, `world`, `undecided`, `empirical`). M — touched-zone maturity (`pencil` exploratory, `stone` accepted core, `—` no canon zone). R — risk flags, recorded in trace shorthand; the implemented vocabulary maps: security, compliance → `security-compliance`; contract, multi-host → `external-contract`; migration → `data-migration`; irreversible → `irreversibility`; multi-team → `multi-team`. Route — documents licensed.

## Examples

Non-normative worked trace, #25 OpenCode adapter: Δ = one new capability (host adapter with contract obligations); Π = machine (adapter obligations recorded in the host-adapter contract) plus world (OpenCode host facts unverified) → research instrument before contract production; M = stone (adapter contract is accepted canon); R = multi-host (→ `external-contract`). Route: rnd → spec → plan — the same route the Codex adapter followed in recorded history.

Non-normative worked trace, Safari button fix: negative canon search, no risk word, no decision → tier-1 grounding short-circuits to null; no document created; no closeout obligation.
