## Overview

This matrix verifies that every shipped document type keeps at least one producer under delta routing (ΔΠMR). The original delta-routing baseline covered 19 types. The research vocabulary added two producers, for 21 reachable types on CLI 0.8.3; the actor-subject vocabulary adds two more, for 23 reachable types on CLI 0.8.4. @plugins/archcore/skills/_shared/research-compatibility.md gates the first pair and @plugins/archcore/skills/_shared/actor-subject-compatibility.md the second. What changes is the engagement condition — today a type fires when its track gate opens and `skip_when` finds no covering document; under delta routing a type fires when the computed Δ, Π, M, R values call for it. "Producer today" cells cite the track files under `@plugins/archcore/skills/_shared/tracks/`.

## Content

| Type | Producer today | Engagement under delta routing | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| `idea` | `sdd.frame` — default first artifact of every sdd run | concept instrument, engaged by the high-uncertainty portfolio (pressure-test before commitment) | narrowed |
| `prd` | `sdd.require` — every full sdd run | umbrella route (`creates` ≥ 2); capability route with `intent_gap` present | narrowed |
| `spec` | `sdd.design`; `decision.cascade` architecture branch; `describe.draft` | capability and umbrella routes — one per capability; amendment target for `modifies`; describe path unchanged | widened |
| `plan` | `sdd.decompose`; `decision.cascade` architecture branch | every executable route; additionally carries the declared Δ and route rationale | widened |
| `rnd` | `research.frame` | Research instrument when the request names a pending decision or a candidate set (closing test), the spike (Goal, Questions, Findings), or the compatibility fallback; no command exposes `rnd` as an entry | widened |
| `research` | `research.frame` | Research instrument when the request names no pending decision — the computed route's `world` source, `plan research`, or a report supplied to `document research`; vision | added |
| `evidence` | `research.gather` | Promoted material inside an investigation, or one external material supplied to `document research`; knowledge | added |
| `scenario` | `sdd.illustrate`; `describe.draft` | illustrate instrument, once per capability that meets the illustrate condition, after that capability's `spec`; `describe.draft` for existing behavior, including `document code` with `scenario` named in the subject; knowledge | added |
| `journey` | `sdd.require` | intent instrument beside the `prd` under the illustrate condition; no `document` mode; vision | added |
| `adr` | `decision.adr`; `decision.resolve` | decision route (`decision` delta); Π `undecided`; a refactor's decision delta | widened |
| `rfc` | `decision.rfc` | decision instrument; solution-shape uncertainty (judged panel of alternatives) | unchanged |
| `rule` | `decision.cascade` standard branch | same producer — `document decision` reaches it through `decision.classify`, directly when one local `adr` already records the decision; input role at grounding stays (conductor reads rules as constraints) | unchanged |
| `guide` | `decision.cascade` standard branch; `describe.draft` | same producers, plus: runbook instrument — package member when a capability's delta introduces an operational procedure, or when R carries `data-migration`; capture target for human-actor procedures at the experience offer and at plan discharge | widened |
| `doc` | `describe.draft` | same producer | unchanged |
| `mrd` | `requirements-cascade.mrd`, sources mode | acquisition instrument — product-scale `intent_gap`, or the `plan sources` mode | narrowed |
| `brd` | `requirements-cascade.brd`, sources mode | acquisition instrument — same condition | narrowed |
| `urd` | `requirements-cascade.urd`, sources mode | acquisition instrument — same condition | narrowed |
| `brs` | `requirements-cascade.brs`, iso mode | iso chain link on a `security-compliance`-flagged capability; full chain via the `plan iso` mode | narrowed |
| `strs` | `requirements-cascade.strs`, iso mode | iso chain link — same condition | narrowed |
| `syrs` | `requirements-cascade.syrs`, iso mode | iso chain link — same condition | narrowed |
| `srs` | `requirements-cascade.srs`, iso mode | iso chain link — same condition | narrowed |
| `task-type` | `experience.offer` | unchanged producer; new consumption — routing input that de-escalates Π; discharge target for a completed `plan` with an agent-actor procedure | widened |
| `cpat` | `experience.offer`; `decision.cascade` opt-in | unchanged producers; new consumption — routing input that de-escalates Π | widened |

Legend: added — introduced by a vocabulary release (research on CLI 0.8.3, actor-subject on CLI 0.8.4); narrowed — the type fires under a stricter computed condition than today's gate order; widened — the type gains a producer, a form, or a consumption role; unchanged — producer and condition survive as they are.

Consumption-side changes the matrix does not show:

- `skip_when` conditioned on document-graph state stops being the routing basis; graph state still closes gates inside an engaged instrument.
- The `brd`/`urd` composition into `sdd.require` (Goals from `brd` metrics, Requirements from `urd` acceptance criteria) survives inside the intent instrument unchanged.
- `task-type` and `cpat` move from output-only to routing inputs — the first types the conductor reads, not only writes at review.
- `guide` gains its first vision-command production path: the runbook instrument adds it to an assembled package, where today no `plan`-command track produces a `guide`.
- The `guide`-versus-`task-type` boundary is the procedure's actor: human → `guide`, agent → `task-type` (instrument-layer spec, behavior 17).
- `scenario` is consumed at `closeout.verify` (readiness and coverage reports) and at `sdd.design` (advisory example check); feature files under `features/*.feature` are read as evidence at `describe.read` and never copied into `.archcore/`.
- No type name is a command entry: a type named in the subject text settles the type question at the gate that selects it.

## Examples

- Issue #25 (OpenCode adapter): `creates` = [opencode-adapter], R = [`external-contract`] → capability route raised to `L`: one `spec`, one `plan`, no `prd` — intent is already recorded by the host-expansion documents. The adapter's local-testing procedure is an operational procedure, so the package adds one `guide` — the artifact the corpus today holds as `codex-local-plugin-testing.guide.md` for the sibling adapter. Types engaged: `spec`, `plan`, `guide`.
- "Fix the Safari button overflow": all Δ lists empty, no `intent_gap` → `null` route. Types engaged: none — the case ~30% of the 40 bench traces resolve to.
- "Plan the beginner conversation flow for the English tutor skill": `creates` = 1 with a conversational, user-facing surface → capability route; the illustrate condition holds, so the package is one `spec`, one `scenario` (`depends_on` → the spec), one `plan`. Types engaged: `spec`, `scenario`, `plan`.
