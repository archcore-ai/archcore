## Purpose

Run, extend, and debug the Archcore plugin's test suite: the full verification gate, the unit and structure suites, the host install smoke tests, the behavioral model benches, and the live-session probes — plus the conventions a new test, a new bin script, or a new host must follow.

## Prerequisites

- [bats-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) — the test runner for shell scripts. macOS: `brew install bats-core`. Linux: `apt install bats`.
- Archcore CLI 0.8.4 or later on PATH for the real MCP integration suite. Set `ARCHCORE_BIN=/absolute/path/to/archcore` to test another installed binary.
- `jq`, ShellCheck, and initialized git submodules. `plugin-development.guide` owns the environment setup; `make verify` fails with a named tool when something is missing, and Common Issues below covers the failures that are specific to the suite.
- The `claude` CLI on PATH, only for the behavioral benches in step 15.

## Steps

### 1. Run the full verification

```bash
make verify
```

Expected result: exit 0 with `All checks passed`. The target runs JSON validation, the permission check, ShellCheck, the unit and structure Bats suites, and the real MCP integration suite. Use this single command before committing.

### 2. Run only the test suite

```bash
make test
```

Runs both unit and structure tests through bats-core. The suite grows with the plugin, so compare against the count `make test` prints rather than against a number written here.

To run a subset:

```bash
make test-unit       # unit tests for bin/ script logic
make test-structure  # structure tests for configs and frontmatter
```

To run a single test file:

```bash
PLUGIN_ROOT=$(pwd)/plugins/archcore REPO_ROOT=$(pwd) bats test/unit/normalize-stdin.bats
PLUGIN_ROOT=$(pwd)/plugins/archcore REPO_ROOT=$(pwd) bats test/unit/hook-launchers.bats
```

`PLUGIN_ROOT` is worth knowing as more than boilerplate: pointing it at a modified copy of `plugins/archcore` is how fault injection works without touching the tree.

Run the real MCP boundary separately with `make test-integration`. @test/integration/research-vocabulary.bats and @test/integration/actor-subject-vocabulary.bats use @test/helpers/mcp.bash to start the installed CLI in a temporary project. They check schemas, templates, categories, directed relations, retry prerequisites, deduplication, and persisted track state. The tests use real storage without model calls.

@test/integration/search-response-shape.bats mounts one global source in that temporary project. It checks that `hits` and `index` precede `results`, that `hits` counts every source before the `limit` cut, that a long body arrives with `body_truncated: true`, that the response byte budget sets `truncated`, and that `list_documents` reaches every document when `offset` advances by `returned`. The file skips on a CLI older than 0.8.5, which sends none of these fields.

The CI workflow pins CLI 0.8.6 and verifies the release archive's SHA-256. The release workflow calls the same Linux/macOS verification workflow against the selected release ref.

### 3. Run the ShellCheck lint

```bash
make lint
```

Expected result: `ShellCheck: all clean`. The target runs `shellcheck -s sh -x` on every `bin/` script; `-x` follows `source` directives so the normalizer library is checked in context. The same target lints the three bench scripts under `test/behavioral/`.

### 4. Run the quick structural checks

```bash
make check-json    # validates all JSON configs via jq
make check-perms   # verifies bin/ scripts are executable
```

Neither needs bats.

### 5. Run the host install smoke tests

```bash
make test-codex-smoke     # requires the codex CLI on PATH
make test-copilot-smoke   # requires the copilot CLI on PATH
```

Neither runs as part of `make test`, and both **skip** rather than fail when their host binary is absent — so they ship, stay quiet in CI, and run for free on a contributor's machine that has the host installed. They cover what static tests cannot: that a real install produces a tree the host can load. That is the exact gap issue #2 fell through for Codex, where every structural test was green while marketplace discovery silently found nothing.

The Copilot smoke test asserts filesystem facts rather than CLI output: every path the manifest names survives the install, the hook scripts keep their executable bit, and no plugin MCP server is registered (github/copilot-cli#4234). Host output wording is not a contract the plugin controls; what the plugin promises is what lands on disk.

The Codex smoke suite uses real marketplace installation for every loading check. It accepts Codex's abbreviated `rN` skill paths and inspects the developer skill catalog rather than matching the user prompt.

### 6. Run the plugin integrity check

`make verify` is the canonical integrity check. The former `/archcore:verify` skill was retired by `skill-surface-collapse.adr`; use the Makefile target instead. Inside a host session, ask the model to run `make verify` and report the results if you want AI-assisted verification.

Two structure files carry the per-host regression guards: `test/structure/host-coverage-matrix.bats` holds one enrolled row per hooks config, with an enrollment guard so a new host cannot ship unchecked, and `test/structure/copilot-plugin.bats`, `codex-plugin.bats`, and `cursor-plugin.bats` cover the per-host manifests.

### 7. Write a new unit test

Unit tests cover `bin/` script logic — stdin parsing, exit codes, output.

1. Create `test/unit/<script-name>.bats`.
2. Add the standard setup:
   ```bash
   setup() {
     load '../helpers/common'
     common_setup
   }
   ```
3. Load the helpers from `test/helpers/common.bash`; the table below lists them.
4. Assert with bats-assert: `assert_success`, `assert_failure <code>`, `assert_output --partial <text>`.

| Helper | Use |
|---|---|
| `run_with_fixture <script> <fixture-path>` | run the script with a fixture file as stdin |
| `run_with_stdin <script> <inline-json>` | run the script with inline stdin |
| `run_with_fixture_env <script> <fixture> <host>` | the same, with `ARCHCORE_HOST` forced — env-only hosts such as opencode need it |
| `mock_archcore <output> [exit-code]` | a mock `archcore` on `PATH` answering *any* subcommand; use only when the test does not care which one ran |
| `mock_archcore_logging <output> [exit-code]` | the same, appending `$1` to `$MOCK_ARCHCORE_LOG` when set; use whenever the test asserts which subcommand ran |
| `mock_archcore_multi` | multi-subcommand mock: `$MOCK_DOCTOR_OUTPUT` for `doctor`, `$MOCK_HOOKS_OUTPUT` for `hooks`, logging to `$MOCK_ARCHCORE_LOG` |
| `run_normalizer <json>` | source `normalize-stdin.sh` and print the exported variables |

For CLI fallback paths, `test/unit/session-start.bats` is the model: under a restricted PATH where `archcore` does not resolve, `bin/session-start` still exits 0 and emits the install message pointing at https://docs.archcore.ai/cli/install/.

One caveat when you compare two runs of `session-start`: `archcore hooks <host> session-start` emits its context only the first time it sees a given project, so two invocations in the same directory are not comparable and the second is legitimately empty. Give each invocation its own project directory — see `test/unit/probe-wrapper.bats`.

### 8. Write a new structure test

Structure tests validate configs and files.

1. Create `test/structure/<topic>.bats`.
2. Use the same setup as a unit test.
3. Reference plugin files through `$PLUGIN_ROOT` and repo-root files through `$REPO_ROOT`.
4. Validate JSON with `jq` and frontmatter with `grep`.
5. Follow `scripts.bats` for the direct `archcore` invocation pattern.
6. Guard README references with `readme-cli-references.bats` against the canonical allowlist.

Prefer a table over a copy when a test is per-host. Four hosts means four near-identical tests, and the fourth is the one nobody writes. Worse, a copied test can pass on an empty set: `jq '.. | .command?'` returns nothing for `hooks/copilot.hooks.json`, whose entries use `bash`. `test/structure/hooks.bats` shows the shape — one table of `host|config|plugin-root-variable`, a union accessor, an assertion that the extraction was not empty, and an enrollment guard so a fifth config cannot slip past the table.

A change to a command's argument hint, mode list, or description is pinned by `test/structure/command-grammar.bats`; update that file together with the skill, the command wrapper, and `test/fixtures/routing/fixtures.tsv`.

A change to the large-or-partial-result guidance is pinned by `test/structure/partial-results.bats`; update that file together with the three assistant surfaces and `skills/_shared/globals.md`.

### 9. Add a stdin fixture

1. Create `test/fixtures/stdin/<host>/<name>.json`.
2. Use one of the host directories: `claude-code/`, `cursor/`, `codex/`, `copilot/`, `opencode/`, `malformed/`.
3. Match the exact JSON structure the hook receives from that host.

Copilot's native payloads are the least guessable: the edited path lives inside an escaped JSON **string** under `toolArgs`, not in a nested object.

### 10. Assert CLI subcommand invocations

`cli-integration-tests.rule` requires that any change touching a script that invokes `archcore` be covered by a test pinning the exact subcommand. The contract holds at two layers.

At the structure layer, `test/structure/readme-cli-references.bats` extracts every backtick-quoted `archcore <subcmd>` reference in `README.md` and asserts membership in the canonical allowlist `config doctor help hooks init mcp status update`, hardcoded in that test file. Internal `.archcore/` design documents are excluded deliberately: they hold historical specification text that may name renamed commands.

At the unit layer, write a test using `mock_archcore_logging` with `MOCK_ARCHCORE_LOG`:

```bash
@test "<script> calls only the expected subcommand" {
  export MOCK_ARCHCORE_LOG="$BATS_TEST_TMPDIR/archcore.log"
  mock_archcore_logging ""
  run_with_fixture <script> <fixture>
  assert_success
  [ -f "$MOCK_ARCHCORE_LOG" ] || fail "expected archcore to be invoked"
  grep -qx '<expected-subcommand>' "$MOCK_ARCHCORE_LOG" \
    || fail "expected '<expected-subcommand>', got: $(cat "$MOCK_ARCHCORE_LOG")"
}
```

A test asserting only `assert_success` after a CLI invocation is insufficient: hooks swallow non-zero exits, so a phantom subcommand fails silently while the test passes. Always assert what was invoked. `test/unit/hook-launchers.bats` is the worked example — it pins `hooks <host> <leaf>` for both `bin/pre-tool-use` and `bin/post-tool-use`.

When the canonical CLI surface changes upstream, update `ARCHCORE_SUBCOMMANDS` in `readme-cli-references.bats` and add an invocation-log assertion for any new subcommand the plugin starts using.

### 11. Add a new bin script

`plugin-development.guide` owns the authoring conventions — shebang, executable bit, normalizer sourcing, shellcheck directive. What the suite then requires of that script:

1. Invoke `archcore <subcmd>` directly through PATH; the plugin bundles no launcher.
2. Wrap the call in `timeout` and `|| true` when the hook must stay non-blocking.
3. Write tests in `test/unit/<name>.bats` with the invocation assertion from step 10.
4. Add a case to `hook-latency.bats` when the script runs under a hook timeout.

Expected result: the structure tests verify permissions and shebang automatically, and `readme-cli-references.bats` guards any new subcommand named in the README.

### 12. Add a new host

1. Add the manifest, the hooks config, and the `normalize-stdin.sh` case (`host-adapter-contract.spec`).
2. Enroll the host in `host-coverage-matrix.bats`.
3. Enroll it in the `hooks.bats` resolution table.
4. Enroll it in the `json-configs.bats` metadata table.
5. Add stdin fixtures under `test/fixtures/stdin/<host>/`.
6. Add a smoke test under `test/integration/`, guarded by `command -v <host> || skip`.
7. Add its row to the probe records table.

Each of the three enrollments carries its own guard and fails until you do it. The probe row becomes mandatory automatically, because `probe-records.bats` derives the host list from the coverage matrix.

### 13. Guard a timing budget

`test/unit/hook-latency.bats` holds the hook timeout budgets — 2 seconds for PreToolUse, 4 for PostToolUse. It measures the plugin's own share (normalize-stdin, the plugin-cache guard, the `cli-gte` probe) against a mocked CLI, so the numbers stay about this repository rather than about the binary, and adds one end-to-end case that skips when no current CLI is installed.

Two conventions there are worth copying into any new timing test. Assert on **marginal** cost, not on a ratio: the launcher carries a fixed cost of roughly 50 ms, and that floor sits in the denominator — an injected per-document scan measured 83 ms at 25 documents and 309 ms at 200, a 226 ms regression that reads as only 3.7× and slips under a 4× bar. And use best-of-N with wide absolute bars, because CI runners are slower and noisier than a laptop while a real regression is a factor of ten.

### 14. Run the live-session probes

Some questions no bats test can answer: whether a host loads the hooks config at all, whether its matcher fires on the tool name the model actually chose, and whether a deny is honored or merely displayed. Those belong to `host-probe-protocol.spec`, and `test/probe/mkprobe` builds the disposable tree they run against. Everything mechanically checkable belongs in bats instead — `test/unit/hook-launchers.bats` is the model, turning "does the launcher reach the right CLI leaf with the payload intact" from a live question into a CI assertion.

### 15. Check model routing and test sensitivity

Three behavioral benches spend model tokens, run only on request, and never run in CI. Each saves raw replies when its `*_OUTPUT_DIR` variable is set, separates mismatches (exit 1) from CLI errors (exit 2), rejects an empty or malformed fixture corpus before any model call, and has a harness test under `test/unit/` that uses a fake model process.

| Target | Script and fixtures | What it measures | Harness test |
|---|---|---|---|
| `make test-routing-bench` | @test/behavioral/route-bench.sh, `test/behavioral/fixtures/routing-bench.tsv` | the route the `plan` conductor announces for a task and its grounding | @test/unit/route-bench.bats |
| `make test-document-bench` | @test/behavioral/document-bench.sh, `test/behavioral/fixtures/document-bench.tsv` | the mode and document type `/archcore:document` selects, including requests with no mode word and no arguments | @test/unit/document-bench.bats |
| `make test-skill-bench` | @test/behavioral/skill-bench.sh, `test/behavioral/fixtures/skill-bench.tsv` | which of the four skills Claude Code starts, and the mode word it passes, for a message that names no command | @test/unit/skill-bench.bats |

The skill bench loads the plugin with `claude -p --plugin-dir`, allows only the Skill tool, turns hooks off, and leaves the built-in skills competing. It measures Claude Code only; Cursor, Codex, and Copilot route through their own hosts. Run `make test-research-agent` separately for the live assistant with a real MCP server.

A harness test verifies bench behavior; the live target verifies model behavior. One run per fixture is a sample, so rerun a failing row several times before changing a description.

Before trusting a changed test, introduce one contract defect in an isolated copy. Preserve its exact diff. Confirm the relevant test fails for that defect, restore the original bytes, and confirm the test passes. Gate goldens now retain normalized `skip_when` conditions; they do not represent all exit-check prose.

## Verification

`plugin-development.guide` owns the `make verify` gate itself. What follows is how to read the suite's own output.

- Every line of the TAP output reads `ok`. Bats prints the total; there is no fixed number to match.
- No `not ok` line appears in the test output.
- ShellCheck reports `all clean`.
- After you break something on purpose — remove the execute bit from a bin script, or rename a bin script the Makefile references — the relevant test fails.

That last item is a habit rather than a formality, and `cli-integration-tests.rule` item 7 makes it an obligation for CLI-invocation tests. A test never observed failing is a test whose failure mode is unknown, which matters most for timing tests, table-driven tests, and anything iterating a set that could be empty. Point `PLUGIN_ROOT` at a modified copy to inject the defect without touching the tree.

## Common Issues

### bats-core not found

```
bats-core not found. Install: brew install bats-core
```

Install bats-core for your platform, as listed under Prerequisites.

### bats-support or bats-assert not found

```
Could not find '.../bats-support/load'
```

The git submodules are not initialized. Run:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

### `timeout` command not found on macOS

The test suite provides a `timeout` shim automatically. If timeout-related failures appear outside the tests, install GNU coreutils with `brew install coreutils`.

### Tests pass locally but fail in CI

- Confirm that `submodules: true` is set in the checkout step of the GitHub Actions workflow.
- Confirm the CI runner has `jq` installed; it is not always pre-installed.
- On Linux `/bin/sh` is `dash`, which is strict POSIX; on macOS `/bin/sh` is bash in POSIX mode. If a test reveals a bashism in a bin script, fix the script — the bin scripts must be POSIX-compatible.
- `hook-latency.bats` is the one timing-sensitive file. Suspect an algorithmic regression before suspecting the runner: its bars sit several times above the measured cost, and the regressions they guard are factors of ten. It skips itself when `perl` is unavailable, and its end-to-end case skips without a current CLI.

### An MCP call rejects `scenario` or `journey` while `archcore --version` reports 0.8.4

The MCP server started before the CLI upgrade still runs the old binary. Reconnect the `archcore` server (in Claude Code, `/mcp`), then retry the call.

### ShellCheck SC2034 in normalize-stdin.sh

A directive at the top of the file suppresses it. The variables — `ARCHCORE_HOST`, `ARCHCORE_TOOL_NAME`, and the rest — are exported for the sourcing scripts.

### The README CLI-reference test fails after a subcommand rename

When the upstream CLI adds, removes, or renames a subcommand, `test/structure/readme-cli-references.bats` may flag an `archcore <subcmd>` reference in the README as phantom. Update `ARCHCORE_SUBCOMMANDS` in that file to match the new surface, then rerun the suite. Per `cli-integration-tests.rule`, any new subcommand the plugin starts invoking also needs a unit-level invocation-log assertion in the corresponding hook test.
