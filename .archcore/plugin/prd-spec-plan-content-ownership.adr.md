## Context

The `sdd` track produces four documents on one topic — `idea`, `prd`, `spec`, `plan` — and they restate each other. Measured on this corpus on 2026-08-13:

- `track-layer-extension.idea`, `.prd`, and `.plan` carry the same statement three times ("frame → gather → conclude, produces `rnd` with Goal, Questions, Approach, Findings, Recommendation, Next Action"), and one line is verbatim in both the `prd` Goals section and the `plan` Acceptance Criteria section.
- 6 of the 8 requirements in `plugin-v2.prd` reappear as numbered behavior in `command-surface-v2.spec`.
- Across the 5 PRDs in this repository and the CLI repository, 2 carry BCP 14 modals and 1 carries 4 EARS clauses — `cli-update-analytics.prd` states 8 numbered behaviors that its own `cli-update-telemetry.spec` also carries.

Four mechanisms produced this:

1. `prd` was the one type in the track with no content contract. The boundary existed only in `spec-contract.md`, which tells a `spec` what to leave to the `prd` and never the reverse.
2. Every gate exit check verified that a section is present. No check asked whether the section repeats the document upstream of it.
3. `sdd.decompose` asks zero questions and composes from upstream drafts, so restatement was the only output it could produce.
4. `skip_when` asked whether a document on the topic exists, never whether content remains to add. The compression path that let a feature-scoped request go straight to the `spec` lived in `skills/plan/references/feature-flow.md`, which the v2 track cutover deleted; only the 40-line target survived into `sdd.require`.

A fifth mechanism was latent: the CLI `prd` template carried 12 top-level sections — including `Solution Overview`, `Constraints`, `Timeline`, and an `FR-###` table with acceptance criteria — against the 4 sections `sdd.require` checks. Skills compose bodies themselves, so the template reached a document only through the empty-content path of `create_document`.

## Decision

Assign every kind of statement produced on one topic to exactly one owning document, record the assignment in a new content contract, `plugins/archcore/skills/_shared/prd-contract.md`, and check its mechanical half in the post-tool-use hook rather than at the gate alone.

1. The contract carries the routing gate in the `prd` → `spec` / `plan` / `adr` direction, mirroring the gate `spec-contract.md` already carries in the opposite direction.
2. The contract carries the content-kind ownership table: a statement written into one document is not written into a second, and a downstream gate that takes over a kind edits the upstream statement down to the kind that document owns, in the same `update_document` call that closes the gate.
3. A `prd` requirement states an outcome. EARS clause order and BCP 14 modals stay out of a `prd`; they are `spec` notation. The ISO requirement types keep their own notation.
4. The coverage category `Completion Signals` reaches three different sections — `prd` Goals and Success Metrics, `plan` Acceptance Criteria, `spec` Conformance — and coverage at one gate does not close the category at another. Recorded as rule 4 of the ownership table; `coverage-taxonomy.md` carries a pointer to it rather than a second copy.
5. `sdd.require`, `sdd.design`, and `sdd.decompose` each gain a blocking exit check that applies the ownership table by reference, per the gate-contract rule against restating a shared contract inside a gate. `sdd.design`'s Purpose states that the gate also calls `update_document` on the `prd`, because the gate record template has no field for a document a gate edits rather than produces.
6. `sdd.require` regains the compression path as a `skip_when` condition: a feature-scoped request whose problem and goals are already recorded in an `idea`, `rnd`, or `adr` continues at `sdd.design`. `sdd.design` and `sdd.decompose` accept that upstream document in place of the `prd`.
7. The CLI `prd` template collapses to the four canonical sections, and `templates.RequiredSections` gains a `prd` entry.
8. Archcore CLI v0.7.2 carries the mechanical checks. The post-tool-use precision hook checks four properties per write, all advisory: the mandatory sections; a BCP 14 modal anywhere in a `prd` body; a numbered line opening with `WHEN`, `WHILE`, or `IF`; and a heading listed in the new `templates.ForeignSections` canon, which names the type that owns it.
9. The same hook checks ownership rule 1 across documents: for each `implements` or `extends` edge touching the written document, it compares list statements against the neighbour's body and reports an overlap of 85% of content words or more. Thresholds are `minRestatementTokens = 6` and `restatementThreshold = 0.85`, calibrated on this corpus — the measured copied line scores 1.0 and the closest genuine `prd`/`spec` pair scores 0.67.
10. The launcher version gate in `bin/pre-tool-use` and `bin/post-tool-use` stays at 0.7.0. That gate asks whether the CLI has a hook runtime at all, not whether it has these checks: raising it would fail open on the write guard, the code-alignment advisory, and the whole precision scan for every user who has not updated, and fail open silently. The new checks degrade to silence on an older CLI, which costs nothing that was previously guaranteed.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Non-redundancy exit checks in the gates, with no contract** — rejected. `gate-contract.md` forbids restating a shared contract's rules inside a gate, so three gates would each carry their own copy of the boundary, which is the drift this decision removes.
2. **Merge `prd` and `spec` into one per-feature document** — rejected in `no-frd-type-prd-scope-rule.adr` as a flow-composition question rather than a type question, and re-rejected here: one document would blur the vision and knowledge categories that the write-affinity model in `command-surface-v2.spec` depends on.
3. **Leave the CLI template and rely on the track alone** — rejected. `create_document` falls back to the template when content is empty, so the 12-section shape stayed reachable and disagreed with the check `sdd.require` runs.
4. **Leave every ownership check to the composing agent** — rejected. The measured failure was a copied sentence, which a script decides without judgement, and an advisory hook costs a glance when it is wrong. A semantic-similarity threshold low enough to catch paraphrase was rejected with it: two documents on one topic share vocabulary, so that setting reports the boundary working as noise.
5. **Raise the launcher gate to the CLI release carrying the checks** — rejected, and measured: with CLI v0.7.1 installed and the gate raised to 0.8.0, `bin/pre-tool-use` exits 0 on a direct `.archcore/*.md` write that the same launcher denies at the current gate with exit 2. The plugin and the CLI install and update separately, so a user reaches that state by updating one of the two.

## Consequences

- Every gate that produces a second document on a topic has one objective question to answer: which document owns this kind of statement.
- A feature-scoped request with its "why" recorded upstream now produces two documents instead of four.
- `prd-contract.md` is the fifth shared content contract; the shared-asset count in `plugin-architecture.spec` moves from 4 to 5.
- The precision hook gains five finding classes, all advisory: a missing mandatory section, a BCP 14 modal, an EARS clause, a foreign heading, and a restated statement. The hook never blocks.
- The restatement check reads at most 5 neighbours per write, and only across `implements` and `extends`. A `related` edge is an association and a `depends_on` edge orders two documents without moving text, so an overlap across either reports nothing.
- Version skew is expected and safe in one direction only: a plugin newer than the CLI loses the five findings and keeps every earlier guarantee. `prd-contract.md` names v0.7.2 in its Enforcement section so the contract does not promise a check the installed CLI lacks.
- Tradeoff: near-verbatim restatement is now decided by a script; **paraphrased** restatement is not, and stays with the composing agent at the gate exit checks. A paraphrase is where the two documents differ legitimately, so the boundary between the two cases is the boundary between a copy and a rewrite. [assumption] The effect of either half on restatement rates has not been measured over time.
- Tradeoff: 2 of the 5 PRDs already in these repositories will report modal findings on their next update. The finding names the fix and does not block it.
- One fact is recorded in one place, including inside this change: the ownership table is the single record of the per-type section assignment, and `coverage-taxonomy.md` and the contract's own Forbidden list point at it instead of repeating it.
- Documents accepted before this decision are not retro-fitted. `track-layer-extension.prd` and `plugin-v2.prd` keep their recorded content.

## Superseded when

- `get_type_schema` ships per `get-type-schema-mcp-tool.idea` and the CLI templates become the single machine-readable section canon, at which point `prd-contract.md` keeps only the routing gate, the ownership table, and the compression path.
- The restatement check is measured against a body of real writes and its threshold proves either noisy or inert, which would retune `restatementThreshold` or withdraw the check.
