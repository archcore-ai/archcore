// wrapper over runPluginActions: one planner decides, one executor acts, and the
// entry points differ only in the lines they print around this one —
// plugin-delivery.spec. An entry point that re-decides what the planner already
// decided breaks that invariant, however reasonable the second decision looks.

// pluginStepBudget bounds the whole plugin step. It protects the latency
// `archcore update` and `archcore init` may spend on it: once it elapses the
// remaining hosts are skipped in silence rather than delaying the command that
// hosts the step — updating-the-plugin.spec, Surface and Failure Behavior 5.
