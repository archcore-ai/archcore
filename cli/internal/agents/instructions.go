// Instruction-nudge files. archcore writes a short, always-on "use Archcore"
// hint into each host's instruction file so that CLI-only users (no Archcore
// plugin) discover and invoke the MCP tools. Under Tool Search, MCP tools are
// deferred — only names load at startup — so an always-on instruction nudge is
// the discovery trigger. See
// instruction-nudge-on-init.adr.
//
// All targets are shared user files written with a fenced-block upsert —
// archcore only ever touches the span between its markers, never surrounding
// user content: AGENTS.md (six agents), GEMINI.md (Gemini CLI), and CLAUDE.md
// (Claude Code).
//
// Claude Code gets CLAUDE.md AND AGENTS.md. Per Anthropic's docs Claude Code
// reads CLAUDE.md natively but does NOT auto-read AGENTS.md, so CLAUDE.md is
// what delivers the nudge to Claude Code; the AGENTS.md block is written too so
// the repo also carries the standard block the plugin and the other hosts
// converge on. Earlier CLI versions instead wrote an owned .claude/rules/
// archcore.md file; that is now migrated away (removed) on install/remove.

// Archcore through its MCP tools (not plugin slash commands — CLI-only users
// have no plugin), and splits the cheap discovery search from the selective
// deep read so invocation tracks relevance, not volume: lean on the search,
// skip only turns the repo would have no opinion on. The skip is keyed on the
// nature of the turn — a prior the agent can form up front — not on whether a
// rule exists, which it cannot know without the very lookup it is told to skip.
// It also flags that a project MAY mount read-only global sources (phrased
// conditionally — most projects have none) that the session-start context omits,
// so the agent learns to surface them via the MCP read tools when present.
// Built via concatenation because a raw string literal cannot contain the
// backticks that wrap `.archcore/`.
