// runs its plan through this function, which is the other half of the invariant
// of plugin-delivery.spec: one planner decides, one executor acts, and the
// entry points differ only in wording.

// Reporter receives every line the executor would otherwise print. Execute
// writes to no stream at all, because the wording is the entry point's to
// choose: `archcore init` reports a delivery inside a setup summary, and
// `archcore plugin status` reports the same evidence as a report of its own.
// The decision is shared; the sentences are not.
