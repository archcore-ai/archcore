// @internal/wiring/hooks_effective.go runs a comparable scan for the
// duplicate-hook notice. It is deliberately not shared. That one is cross-host
// and informational, and requirement 3 of plugin-cli-compatibility.rule keeps
// reads of host plugin state inside this surface, where they are allowed to
// decide something.

	// the first level and never find the plugin.

// (cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>), so a namesPlugin test matched the marketplace
// directory and returned before the plugin level was ever read — reporting the
// plugin installed on a machine that only ever ran `marketplace add`, which
// install then treats as a no-op and never installs. identifiesPlugin draws the
