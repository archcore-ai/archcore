// Package telemetry sends anonymous product events to Archcore's first-party
// PostHog proxy.
//
// The contract is cli-update-telemetry.spec. Four
// properties of this package are load-bearing and must survive any refactor:
//
//  1. A build without a release key is inert. The key arrives through an -X
//     ldflag at release time, so a `go build`, a `go install`, a fork and a CI
//     build send nothing by construction — the same property install.sh gets
//     from deploy-time substitution.
//  2. Opting out leaves no trace on disk. All three guards run before the
//     install-id file is read or created.
//  3. Nothing here can fail a command. Capture returns no error, prints
//     nothing, and is safe on a nil receiver, so a caller needs no branch for
//     "telemetry is off".
//  4. The install-id file is shared with install.sh and install.ps1, so one
//     machine resolves to one distinct_id across the installer and the CLI.
//
// Capture reports delivery so the caller can print a disclosure line only for
// an event the endpoint accepted. A dropped event and a delivered one must not
// look the same in the terminal.
