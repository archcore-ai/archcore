package update

// The unattended-update policy: every condition that must hold before this
// process replaces its own binary with nobody watching — unattended-update.spec.
// The trigger supplies the moment; this file supplies the conditions, in the
// fixed order §1 and §2 require.
//
// Three properties shape the code below and are easy to erase in a refactor:
//
//  1. Every refusal before the claim is silent. A refusal is not a failure: an
//     event sent for one would count forks, development builds and CI runners as
//     machines that tried and could not, and `cli_update_failed` would stop
//     meaning "an attempted step did not complete" —
//     cli-update-telemetry.spec.
//  2. Both reportable skips sit after the claim. That is what makes "at most one
//     cli_update_skipped per machine per window" true however many callers start
//     — unattended-update.spec.
//  3. No property carries an error message, a path, a directory name, a user
//     name, a host name or repository data. The stage travels as a typed value
//     through StageOf; err.Error() never enters a property.
//
// The policy writes to no stream and never terminates, restarts or re-execs its
// caller: `archcore mcp` owns stdout as a protocol stream, and the running
// process keeps executing the image it started with.

// a stalled network for as long as the transport allows. Two minutes covers a
// version lookup, an archive download and a checksum fetch on a slow link
// [assumption] — unattended-update.spec.
//
// It does not bound the staged write, the health probe or the rename: a ceiling
// that tears the replace step defeats the atomicity contract, so healthProbe
// takes its bound from context.WithoutCancel and atomicReplace never reads the
// deadline at all.
