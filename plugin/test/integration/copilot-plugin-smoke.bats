# Integration smoke checks for GitHub Copilot CLI plugin packaging + discovery.
#
# Copilot has no marketplace catalog — installation is `copilot plugin install`
# against a directory or `<repo>:<subdir>` spec — so the discovery surface this
# file exercises is the install itself plus what lands on disk afterwards.
#
# The assertions are deliberately filesystem-shaped rather than output-shaped.
# Copilot's CLI output wording is not a contract we control, and a smoke test
# that greps for a phrase breaks on a release note. What the plugin actually
# promises is that every component the manifest points at survives packaging
# with its permissions intact — that is checkable exactly, and it is what broke
# for Codex in issue #2.
#
# Like the Codex smoke test, this ships and skips where the host is absent, so
# a contributor with Copilot installed runs it for free and CI stays quiet.
