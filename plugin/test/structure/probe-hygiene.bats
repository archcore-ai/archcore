# No probe harness residue reaches the shipped plugin.

# hooks-validation-system.spec conformance 13 says no committed code contains a
# probe line, and that clause is the reason the first attempt at a probe
# protocol stalled: the only way anyone knew to observe a delegated hook call
# was to add a marker to a real script, which the conformance rule forbids and
# review would have caught anyway.
#
# mkprobe resolves it by wrapping scripts in a COPY. That only holds while
# nobody takes the shortcut, so this file asserts the shape rather than trusting
# the habit: the harness lives under test/, and plugins/ carries no wrapper, no
# .real sibling, and no probe marker.
