# The probe records table is complete and well-formed.

# host-adapter-contract.spec makes a dated probe record item 6 of what every
# adapter MUST provide, and repeats it in Conformance. Before
# host-probe-protocol.spec existed there was no protocol, no format and no
# records — the contract's most expensive requirement was also the only one
# nothing checked. This file makes it checkable.
#
# The host list is derived from host-coverage-matrix.bats rather than repeated
# here, so a fifth host cannot join the plugin without also owing a row.
