# Structure tests: golden checks for gate prose in track files.
#
# Pins the load-bearing gate fields of every track under
# plugins/archcore/skills/_shared/tracks/ — routing structure (Next targets),
# skip paths (skip_when), budgets, taxonomy knobs, and Produces type/status —
# so changes to these fields fail CI. Exit-check prose needs separate tests.
# The normalized records come
# from test/helpers/extract-gates.sh; the pinned values live in
# test/fixtures/goldens/<track>.golden.
#
# Regenerating a golden after an INTENTIONAL gate-prose change:
#   1. Re-run the extractor over the changed track:
#        test/helpers/extract-gates.sh \
#          plugins/archcore/skills/_shared/tracks/<track>.md \
#          > test/fixtures/goldens/<track>.golden
#   2. Review `git diff test/fixtures/goldens/<track>.golden`. Every changed
#      line must correspond to the semantic change you meant to make (a gate
#      added or renamed, a routing target, a skip path, a budget, a taxonomy
#      category, a produced type). An unexpected changed line means the prose
#      edit silently altered gate semantics — fix the track, not the golden.
#   3. Commit the regenerated golden together with the track change.
#
# The cross-track tests below are computed live from the track files (not from
# the goldens), so they hold even while a golden is being regenerated.
