# Structure tests: v2 command-surface purity (plan task 27, Stage 5).
#
# Acceptance criterion: "CI grep finds no /archcore:{context,capture,decide,
# audit,help} string in shipped files."
#
# Until the Stage 4 cutover this suite was a RATCHET around a hardcoded LEGACY
# allowlist of files still legitimately carrying stale strings. Stage 4 deleted
# the old skills/wrappers (task 21) and swept the survivors (task 22), so the
# allowlist is retired and the acceptance criterion holds directly:
#   - Test 1 greps the ENTIRE shipped plugin tree and requires zero hits.
#   - Test 2 guards the v2 core set file-by-file, so a renamed or deleted core
#     file is reported as MISSING instead of silently dropping out of Test 1's
#     coverage.
#   - Test 3 guards the shipped repo-root adjacents (.claude-plugin/,
#     .cursor-plugin/, .agents/, docs/).
#
# Pattern choice: the tree was checked on 2026-08-05 for slash-less forms
# (`archcore:capture` in backticks etc.) — zero occurrences; every stale
# string carried the leading slash. STALE_RE nevertheless omits the slash so
# a future backticked or plugin-qualified form (e.g. `archcore:help`) is
# caught too. Portable grep only: -r/-l/-n/-I/-E (no -P, works on GNU + BSD).
#
# Scope: shipped locations only — the plugin tree plus the four repo-root
# adjacents above. test/, Makefile, and .github/ are not shipped and may
# mention old commands (fixtures, this file's own pattern).
