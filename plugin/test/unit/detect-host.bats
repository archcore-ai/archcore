#!/usr/bin/env bats
# Contract specs for bin/detect-host.
#
# Purpose (cwd-independence): the /archcore:init skill needs to know which
# host it runs under WITHOUT trusting cwd or stdin (Cursor does not guarantee
# either for agent shell commands). detect-host resolves the host from
# environment only and prints EXACTLY ONE token on stdout:
#
#   claude-code | cursor | codex-cli | __UNKNOWN__
#
# Contract:
#   - env-only: never reads stdin, never inspects cwd;
#   - exactly one line, no decoration, always exit 0 (callers branch on the
#     token; __UNKNOWN__ is a value, not an error);
#   - precedence when multiple host envs are present: claude-code > cursor >
#     codex-cli (a Claude-spawned subshell may inherit stray vars; the most
#     specific signal wins).
#
# Env signals (keep these constants in sync with the script):
#   claude-code: CLAUDECODE=1 or CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR set
#   cursor:      CURSOR_TRACE_ID set
#   codex-cli:   CODEX_THREAD_ID set (host-injected, the real marker) or
#                CODEX_HOME set (user-exported config dir, fallback only)
#   copilot:     NONE — see the __UNKNOWN__ test below. Copilot CLI exports no
#                marker into agent shell commands, so it is deliberately absent
#                from the token set and the init skill asks the user instead.
#
# The exec-bit check is a hard assertion (not a skip): a lost exec bit must
# turn the suite red, not silently green it via 10 skips. `env -i` gives a
# hermetic environment (only PATH survives) so developer machines running
# inside Claude Code don't leak CLAUDECODE into the tests.
