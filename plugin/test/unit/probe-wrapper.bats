# The probe wrapper is transparent.
#
# mkprobe replaces each guard with a logging wrapper that execs the original.
# Everything a probe run concludes rests on that wrapper being invisible: if it
# swallowed a stderr line, a probe would record "the host showed no reason" for
# a guard that did produce one; if it flattened a non-zero status, probe B would
# record a deny that never happened. A green probe would then be an artifact of
# the harness rather than evidence about the host — worse than running no probe
# at all, because it gets written down as fact.
#
# So the wrapper is compared against the untouched script across every stdin
# fixture in the suite: same stdout, same stderr, same exit status. The set
# includes malformed payloads on purpose — fail-open paths are where a wrapper
# is most likely to differ.
