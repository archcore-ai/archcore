# Emit-shape matrix for bin/session-start's own _archcore_emit_info and the
# copilot output-channel pins.
#
# _archcore_emit_info is a LOCAL sibling of lib/normalize-stdin.sh's
# archcore_hook_info with a DIFFERENT shape table (codex/cursor get plain text
# here, not a JSON wrapper), so it cannot enroll in
# output-helpers-matrix.bats' expected_shape_ok — this file is its dedicated
# matrix (driven through the missing-.archcore arm, which routes through the
# function on every host).
#
# The channel pins document the copilot stdout contract: exactly one JSON
# document (the CLI hook's), any advisory/staleness lines trail as plain
# text. Host tolerance of trailing text is a live-probe item
# (host-probe-protocol.spec.md); these tests pin the plugin-side shape so it
# can only change deliberately.

# --- copilot single-document contract -------------------------------------------
#
# Copilot's documented stdout rule (docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/
# hooks-reference): a line that is a single complete JSON object with
# "type":"progress" is consumed as a progress event and REMOVED from the
# output stream. "Every other line — blank lines, plain text, and JSON objects
# that are not progress messages — is preserved verbatim." When the hook exits
# the preserved lines are concatenated, trimmed, and parsed with a SINGLE
# JSON.parse call; if that fails, "the hook is treated as producing no output".
#
# So trailing plain text after the CLI hook's JSON does not degrade to "context
# plus a note" — it discards the whole payload, the ~9 KB of Archcore context
# included. Every advisory on this host therefore has to arrive INSIDE the one
# document, and these tests assert exactly that: strip the progress lines, and
# what remains must parse as one document, with every message present in it.

# Applies the host rule to "$output" and prints the resulting document.
# Fails the test if the remainder is not exactly one JSON document.
