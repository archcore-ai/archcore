# Multi-host stdin normalization for Archcore plugin hook scripts.
# Source this file at the top of each bin/ script that receives hook stdin.
#
# Exports:
#   ARCHCORE_HOST       — "claude-code" | "cursor" | "copilot" | "codex" | "opencode"
#                         (detected from stdin, or forced via the env var)
#   ARCHCORE_RAW_STDIN  — unmodified stdin JSON
#   ARCHCORE_TOOL_NAME  — normalized tool name (mcp__archcore__* prefix for MCP tools)
#   ARCHCORE_FILE_PATH  — target file path from tool input (empty if N/A)
#   ARCHCORE_DOC_PATH   — document path from MCP tool input (empty if N/A)
#
# Functions:
#   archcore_hook_block "reason"  — block operation, exit (PreToolUse)
#   archcore_hook_info  "message" — emit info to agent (PostToolUse)
#   archcore_hook_allow           — allow operation silently, exit 0
#   archcore_cursor_qualify_mcp_tool — print the payload with Cursor's bare
#                                 archcore tool name qualified (see below)
#
# OpenCode bridge contract (host-adapter-contract.spec): the TS bridge spawns
# these scripts with ARCHCORE_HOST=opencode in env and a Claude-shaped
# snake_case JSON payload on stdin. Block = exit 2 + reason on stderr (the
# bridge throws Error(stderr)); info output is plain text on stdout, which the
# bridge appends verbatim as context. No JSON parsing on the bridge side.

# --- Read stdin once ---
ARCHCORE_RAW_STDIN=$(cat)

# --- Host detection ---
# Priority: env var override > stdin heuristic > default
#
# Cursor sends "conversation_id" in all hook events.
# GitHub Copilot (native camelCase format) sends "toolName"/"toolArgs"; its
#   legacy Claude-compat payloads carry "hookEventName". The copilot hooks
#   config pins ARCHCORE_HOST=copilot via per-entry env, so this heuristic is
#   a fallback only. camelCase keys never appear in the snake_case schemas of
#   Claude Code / Codex, nor in Cursor payloads (checked first).
# Codex CLI sends "turn_id" in turn-scoped events (PreToolUse/PostToolUse/etc.); SessionStart
#   has no turn_id but Codex shares Claude Code's snake_case schema, so the claude-code
#   fallback handles SessionStart correctly.
# Claude Code sends none of the above — fallback default.
# OpenCode has no stdin heuristic by design: its bridge always sets
#   ARCHCORE_HOST=opencode and sends Claude-shaped snake_case payloads.

# to know which:
#
#   mcp__archcore__<tool>                    project .mcp.json (Claude Code, Codex)
#   mcp__plugin_archcore_archcore__<tool>    plugin-bundled server (Claude Code)
#   archcore-<tool>                          Copilot flattens to "<server>-<tool>"
#
# Everything downstream gates on the project naming alone. Without this fold, a
# session using either of the other two registrations fires those hooks and
# they silently no-op — the failure mode host-wiring-parity.adr calls out for
# the hook MATCHERS, which carry both namings; matchers decide *whether* a
# script runs, this decides *what it sees*. Both layers are needed.

# --- Cursor post-event tool-name qualification ---
# Cursor's afterMCPExecution payload carries a BARE tool name ("update_document")
# plus "mcp_server_name", the server's key in mcp.json. The CLI recognizes the
# qualified spellings only (mcp__archcore__*, mcp__plugin_archcore_archcore__*,
# archcore-*, …), so a bare name reaches its post-tool-use gate as a foreign
# tool and the write gets no validation, cascade, or precision report — silently.
#
# This prints a copy of the raw payload with that ONE value qualified, and
# returns 0, when every condition below holds; otherwise prints nothing and
# returns 1, and the caller keeps the raw payload:
#   - host is cursor and the event is afterMCPExecution;
#   - mcp_server_name is exactly "archcore" — the key `archcore init --agent
#     cursor` writes and docs/cursor.mcp.example.json documents. A payload
#     without the field cannot prove Archcore owns the tool; a bare name that
#     merely looks like ours is not evidence (a foreign server may register an
#     update_document too), so it stays untouched;
#   - tool_name is a bare name the archcore server registers (the CLI folds
#     nothing else);
#   - the payload holds exactly one unescaped "tool_name" key. tool_input and
#     result_json are JSON *strings* in this event, so a tool_name inside them
#     is escaped (\"tool_name\") and never matches; a second real key means a
#     shape this translation was not written for, and guessing would be worse
#     than the silent no-op.
# The rewrite is anchored on the key AND the exact bare value, so document
# content and nested strings are never touched. Policy stays in the CLI: this
# is a name translation, not a gate — the CLI still decides whether the event
# triggers a scan.

# --- Output helpers ---

# Block the current operation (for gatekeeping hooks like preToolUse).
# Exit code 2 blocks in Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex; the OpenCode bridge
# translates exit 2 + stderr into a thrown error (see host-adapter-contract).
#
# GitHub Copilot takes the stdout-JSON arm, but not because exit 2 fails to
# block there. The hooks reference (re-read 2026-07-27) says the opposite of
# what this comment used to claim: "exit 2 is treated as a deny: any stdout
# JSON is merged with the deny decision and the tool call is denied even if
# that JSON reports permissionDecision: allow", and "Other non-zero exits
# denies the tool call with Denied by preToolUse hook (hook errored)". So on
# Copilot every non-zero exit denies; what exit 2 does NOT carry is our reason
# text. The permissionDecisionReason field is the only way to tell the user
# WHY, which is why this arm stays — with exit 0, where the docs say stdout is
# parsed as hook output.
#
# The corollary is a hazard, not a nicety: a guard that dies for an unrelated
# reason (missing interpreter, unresolved plugin root) denies the tool call
# rather than passing it through. hooks/copilot.hooks.json therefore resolves
# the plugin root through a candidate chain and exits 0 when it finds nothing.
