# Structure tests: the delta-routing conductor contract and its wiring.
#
# The conductor contract (skills/_shared/delta-routing.md) is the route
# computation the plan skill loads at its Route step. These tests pin the
# contract's presence, the companion contracts it references, the plan skill's
# loading reference, the instrument registry's gate targets (every registry
# entry must resolve to a real '### gate:' heading in its track file), the
# five route names, the route announcement template, and the expert-path
# argument hint.
